## How To Install Django Web Framework on Ubuntu 

### Introduction
Django is a powerful Python web framework for building dynamic websites and applications. With Django, you can quickly develop Python web applications, relying on the framework to handle much of the heavy lifting.

In this guide, you'll learn how to install Django on an Ubuntu 22.04 server and set up a new project as the foundation for your site.

### Different Installation Methods
There are several ways to install Django, depending on your requirements and development environment preferences. Here are the main methods:

- Global Install from Packages: Simple installation using Ubuntu's apt packagfetche manager. May not offer the latest Django version.

- Install with pip in a Virtual Environment: Recommended method for flexibility and isolation. Allows you to install Django within a project directory without affecting the system-wide Python environment.

- Install the Development Version with Git: For accessing the latest features and fixes, albeit with potentially reduced stability.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have:

A non-root user with sudo privileges set up on your Ubuntu 22.04 server.

```
sudo apt update
```
Check your Python version (Ubuntu 22.04 defaults to Python 3.10):

```
python3 -V
```
Install Django:

```
sudo apt install python3-django
```
Verify the installation:

```
django-admin --version
```
### Install with pip in a Virtual Environment

```
python3 -V
```
Install pip and venv:

```
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv
```
Create and activate a virtual environment:

```
mkdir ~/newproject
cd ~/newproject
python3 -m venv my_env
source my_env/bin/activate
```
Install Django:

```
pip install django
```
Verify the installation:

```

Check Python version:

```
python3 -V
```
Install pip and venv:

```

```
Install Django from the repository:

```
pip install -e ~/django-dev
```
Verify the installation:

```
